# Uivonim

Uivonim is a fork of [Veonim](https://github.com/veonim/veonim/commit/f780b7fc8079755ecac65b475eee3c6358857696),
"a simple modal IDE built on Neovim and VSCode extensions" with WebGL GPU
rendering and multithreading, but which is no longer maintained. The goal of
Uivonim is to use Veonim as a base for building a feature-rich cross-platform GUI that leverages the latest 
Neovim features (floating windows, builtin LSP, Lua), without reliance on VSCode
extensions.

## Goals

- 100% compatibility with Neovim (see [#9421](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/9421))
- All configuration done via vimrc with vimscript/Lua/remote plugins
- Opt-in GUI features and eyecandy
- Fully keyboard driven (no mouse support)
- Fast, building upon the work done by @breja, with things like WebGL GPU
  rendering and multithreading

## Getting Started

Download the latest GitHub release, or build from source (see the "build" section at the bottom of this README).

## Other Cool Projects

- [Oni2](https://github.com/onivim/oni2)
- [GoNeovim](https://github.com/akiyosi/goneovim)
- [gnvim](https://github.com/vhakulinen/gnvim)
- [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim)

## Build

Install the following things:

- node/npm
- latest Neovim

Then run:

- `npm install` - standard issue download 5 million node_modules
- `npm run build` - release build of the code
- `npm run start:release` (optional) - run the release code without packaging
- `npm run package` - use electron-builder to create a binary package

Binaries available in `dist`.

## Special Thanks

An absolutely massive thank you to [@breja](https://github.com/breja) for all
of the work you did on the original Veonim project; without your work
(including the amazing achievement of making Electron snappy!) and vision 
for the original project, Uivonim would not exist. Thank you!
